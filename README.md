## Overview

This utility currently exports/imports:
* The project
* The ontology, including terms and hierarchy
* The users involved in the project
* The images involved in the project
* The human annotations in the project
* The metadata (properties, attached files and description) related to these resources.

If a project with the same name already exists in the destination instance, a (x) is added where x is a natural number.

If an ontology with the same name and the same terms already exists in the destination instance, this ontology is used. Otherwise a new one is created.

If a user with the same username, first name, last name and email already exists in the destination instance, this user is used. Otherwise a new one is created.

If an image with the same filename and dimensions already exists in the destination instance, this image is used. Otherwise a new one is uploaded and created.

## Usage

### Export a project

From the command line:
```bash
python export.py --host CYTOMINE_HOST --public_key PUB_KEY --private_key PRIV_KEY --id_project ID --working_path /home
```

### Import a project
From the command line:
```bash
python import.py --host CYTOMINE_HOST --public_key PUB_KEY --private_key PRIV_KEY --project_path /home/MY_PROJECT.tar.gz
```
